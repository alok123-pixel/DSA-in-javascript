# 📘 DSA in JavaScript

Welcome to my **DSA in JavaScript** repository! 🚀  
This repo is dedicated to learning and practicing **Data Structures and Algorithms** in JavaScript.  
Here, I will cover **all core DSA topics** along with **pattern-wise questions** for interview preparation.

## 🎯 Pattern-Wise Problem Solving

This repo also organizes problems **pattern-wise**, which is very useful for coding interviews:

- 🔑 **Sliding Window** – Longest substring, max/min subarray problems  
- 🔑 **Two Pointers** – Pair sum, triplet sum, sort problems  
- 🔑 **Fast & Slow Pointers** – Linked list cycle, middle element  
- 🔑 **Merge Intervals** – Meeting rooms, interval scheduling  
- 🔑 **Backtracking** – N-Queens, Sudoku Solver  
- 🔑 **Dynamic Programming** – Knapsack, LIS, LCS  
- 🔑 **Graphs & BFS/DFS** – Islands problem, shortest path  
- 🔑 **Greedy** – Minimum coins, activity selection
